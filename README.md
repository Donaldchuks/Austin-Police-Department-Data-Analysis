## INTRODUCTION
In the midst of chaos, a single phone call can be the difference between life and death. For the men and women who answer 911 calls, every moment counts. But what if we could uncover patterns and insights within these critical moments to improve response times and save more lives?

I dug into nearly 96,000 911 calls received by the Austin Police Department to find out. What I discovered has the potential to transform emergency response in Austin and beyond.

This report presents an in-depth analysis of 911 call data from the Austin Police Department (APD). By examining key metrics such as response times, incident types, and geographic patterns, this analysis aims to uncover actionable insights to improve resource allocation and operational efficiency.
The ultimate goal is to provide recommendations backed by evidence to enhance APDâ€™s ability to respond to emergencies promptly by reducing response times and ensuring a safer community for all.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Despite the high volume of 911 calls, ensuring timely and effective responses remains a critical challenge for the Austin Police Department. As part of my portfolio project, this analysis is focused on analyzing a subset of 96,000 911 calls to identify patterns and trends that can inform resource allocation and optimization.
